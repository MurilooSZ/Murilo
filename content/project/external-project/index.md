A report on the process for creating a product based on the algebra of spectral bands, creating indices. Downloading, acquiring the images, color composing them and analyzing them.

The composition of images through the algebra of spectral bands of sensor systems allows us to highlight or contrast desirable characteristics present in the image or study area, assisting in the interpretation of the satellite image.

Finally, with the help of SCP pluing, supervised classification of the elements present in the study area was carried out.

In the supervised method we must insert intelligence for it to classify, because of this we can achieve greater accuracy, especially if whoever is providing the parameters knows the business problems or issues in the field well.

Classification based on spectral distance ended with good accuracy and accuracy considering little sampling was done, as the computer was unable to process many samples.
