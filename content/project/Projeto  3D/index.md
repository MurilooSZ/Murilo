A planting project was developed in an area of ​​200 hectares close to the city of Mirassol d'Oeste, MT. The planting lines were arranged following the contour lines of the terraces, with a spacing of 7 meters between them. Simultaneously, a spraying project was implemented in an area of ​​100 hectares, where headland maneuvers were fully automated, resulting in a fully automated spraying path.
