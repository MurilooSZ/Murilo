A planting project was developed in an area of ​​200 hectares close to the city of Mirassol d'Oeste, MT. The planting lines were arranged following the contour lines of the terraces, with a spacing of 7 meters between them. Simultaneously, a spraying project was implemented in an area of ​​100 hectares, where headland maneuvers were fully automated, resulting in a fully automated spraying path.

Benefits of Systematization Projects:


• Increased Productivity: More efficient planting and spraying lead to better yields and less waste of inputs.


• Cost Reduction: Automation and optimization reduce operational costs and input expenses.


• Sustainability: More rational use of pesticides and fertilizers, minimizing environmental impact.


• Precision and Control: Better control over agricultural operations, with accurate data to support decisions.
