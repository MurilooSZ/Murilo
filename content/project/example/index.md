A data flow was developed, covering statistical analysis of variables, data set processing, model creation, model validation and testing. After identifying the properties with the highest correlation with the target variable (soybean productive potential), data analysis was carried out applying machine learning through multiple linear regression, using the Python programming language.

In statistical metrics, we obtained an R-squared value (RÂ²) of 0.86 and an RMSE value of 0.04, indicating adequate precision and accuracy.

Overall, the model performed well, especially considering the limited amount of data available for more extensive training, which made a more complete standardization check difficult.
