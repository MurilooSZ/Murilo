Create a proposal for Precision Agriculture (AP) solutions for a Model Farm, containing at least 5 precision agriculture solutions. For each solution, a summary was made of which business "pain/problem" it would help at Fazenda Modelo.
The work was presented to all students using PowerPoint.

Proposed Solutions:

Mapping of the farm and definitions of the environment of each plot with vegetative indices;

Avoid planting failures;

Improve the use of area and productivity;

Improve sending harvesting/planting/spraying data and also machine parameters remotely;

Remote sensing.
