Development of a data analysis script in Python, following the stages of data extraction and understanding, data preparation, modeling, results evaluation, and presentation.

In summary, crop modeling is a scientific technique that integrates agricultural information, environmental data, and computational technology to simulate the growth, development, and production of agricultural plants.

For this study, three databases were used: historical productivity, historical climate, and input estimates. The variables considered include precipitation (P), temperature (T), evapotranspiration by Penman-Monteith (ETP), accumulated deficit (NAC), and current water storage in the soil (ARM).

The Lasso Regression model presented the best results, achieving the highest values in the statistical metrics of MAE, MSE, MAPE, and ùëÖ2. 

As a result, an average production estimate of 4,520 tons of soybeans for the 2024/25 harvest was obtained.
