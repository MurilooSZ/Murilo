Based on data on soil sand content, interpolation was carried out using the Kriging method.

Using experimental data on soil sand content, adjusting the different semivariogram models and determining which one best fits the data. Using the notes on the statistical parameters, the model was chosen.

Based on the results, the best semivariogram model is the “GAUSSIAN”, as its RMSE has a value of 8.877 and an R2 of 0.994. Remembering that the Gaussian model curve best represents the distribution of my data in space.
